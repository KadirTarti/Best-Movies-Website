# The BEst Movies of Recent Times

https://best-movie-of-recent-times.netlify.app/

## Description 🟢

Hello everyone! In this project, some of the movies on the list of the best movies of recent times on the imdb website were shot from a specific database and printed on the screen. You can search for a movie by entering the movie name in the 'Search Movie' search bar at the top. The feature of this search is that it filters the data according to the entered input and displays it on the screen.
When you click on the card structures containing the movies, an information card opens. This card displays the name of the film's director, shooting year, IMDb rating, the names of its writers and a 'Go to Imdb' button. When users click on this button, they are directed to the IMDb page related to that movie.
